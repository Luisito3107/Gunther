# Changelog from v3.0.0 to v3.1.0

## Added
 - None.


## Removed
 - None.


## Fixed
 - None.


## Changed
 - `/queue` command now shows current track thumbnail.
 - Guild options now have their own handler. They will no longer be stored in the player and will have nothing to do with it.
 - Autoplay now have their own handler for versatility. Maybe a command to add a mix of songs to the queue will be added in a future update.
 - `/help` command will now ignore the first slash (/) of the optional argument string.
 - Fixed some typos.


## Notes
 - Update from v3.0.0 to v3.1.0 should work without problems.
