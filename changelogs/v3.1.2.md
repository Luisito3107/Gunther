# Changelog from v3.1.1 to v3.1.2

## Added
 - None.


## Removed
 - `spotify-api.js` unused package.
 - Remaining KSoft lyrics engine code (as KSoft API is not working anymore).


## Fixed
 - Updated `erela.js` package to build version. `Unexpected token in JSON at position 0` when playing songs is fixed now.


## Changed
 - Updated `package.json` file.


## Notes
 - Update from v3.1.1 to v3.1.2 should work without problems (assuming that the `erela.js` package does not undergo any major changes; a future update will address this).
